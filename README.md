# Data Cleaning for Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning and preprocessing using Python for machine learning. The goal is to prepare a dataset for machine learning tasks by applying various data cleaning techniques. The project is built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib and various data processing libraries. The environment for the project is managed using Conda.

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal or Git Bash:
```  
cd your_folder  
git clone "https://github.com/Awesome-AI-ML-DELTA25/DataCleaning.git"
```

### Step 2: Install Conda (if not already installed)
Ensure you have installed either anaconda or miniconda.
