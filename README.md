- Unzip the data (use !unzip on terminal or use python package zipfile)
- Load the data into a pandas dataframe
- Clean the data (up to your discretion)
- Work solo or in pairs
- Ensure that your code is well commented
- Create a jupyter notebook to document your work
- Create a README file to explain your project, your process, and your findings
